Ladies and gentlemen, while the proposition speaks of "shields," what they are actually proposing are shackles—shackles that will bind the hands of innovators, crush open-source competition, and ultimately leave us more vulnerable, not less.

First, let us address the inevitable consequence of "strict" regulation: the monopolization of intelligence. Strict compliance regimes are prohibitively expensive. They act as a moat that protects Big Tech incumbents while drowning startups and open-source researchers. If we vote for this motion, we are voting to concentrate the power of AI into the hands of a few mega-corporations, the only ones with the deep pockets to navigate a labyrinth of bureaucracy. The democratization of AI is the best defense against bias and tyranny, yet strict laws will kill it in the cradle.

Second, the proposition confuses the tool with the crime. We do not need new strict laws to make fraud, defamation, or discrimination illegal—they already *are* illegal. Whether a bad actor uses a printing press, the internet, or an LLM to commit fraud, the law already applies. By attempting to regulate the *technology* itself—the math and the code—rather than the malicious *actions*, we risk criminalizing curiosity and banning the very tools that could solve climate change or cure cancer. We should enforce existing laws, not preemptively ban potential technologies based on fear.

Finally, we must look at the geopolitical reality. We do not exist in a vacuum. If we kneecap our own development with strict, inflexible laws, our adversaries will not follow suit. They will race ahead, developing superior AI capabilities while we are stuck filling out compliance forms. To cede leadership in the most transformative technology of our time is a strategic suicide we cannot afford.

We must champion innovation, accountability through existing legal frameworks, and open competition. Strict laws are a panic reaction, not a policy solution. I urge you to oppose the motion.
